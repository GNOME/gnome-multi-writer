Feb 22 2018  On Solus Linux with software uptodate I have this problem.

After successfully creating a USB with a manjaro ISO I tried to do the same with a Debian ISO.

However it copied the original manjaro ISO.

In the filemager, I right-clicked the Debian ISO and selected "open with/other program/gnome-multi-writer"

It copied the original manjaro ISO

I renamed the manjaro ISO and gnomewriter failed with a file not found message.

As a workaround I renamed the debian ISO (mv debian.ISO manjaro.ISO) and the multiwriter tells me it was successful.

I could not see an option to raise an issue on this project, so I hope you get my feedback

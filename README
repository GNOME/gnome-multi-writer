              GNOME MultiWriter

GNOME MultiWriter can be used to write an ISO file to multiple USB devices at
once. Once an .img or .iso file is chosen it can be written to up to 24 USB
devices simultaneously. Supported drive sizes are between 1Gb and 32Gb.

MultiWriter was originally written as part of the ColorHug project but  was
split off as an independent application in 2015.

This application may possibly be useful to:

 * Copy a specific ISO for QA testing for a small number of users
 * Create a GNOME LiveCD of Fedora Rawhide for a code sprint
 * Create hundreds of LiveUSB drives for the ColorHug project

Bugs (and pull requests) accepted on GitHub; if there's sufficient interest
I'll move the project to git.gnome.org after a few releases.
